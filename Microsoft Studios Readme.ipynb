    "This project aims to discover how to make the most profitable movie possible in order to make business recommendations to Microsoft. Descriptive analyses of a variety of data on previously released movies reveal that the most profitable movie Microsoft could make is an adventure movie with an NR rating, directed by Jean Negulsesco, with a runtime between 100 minutes and 131 minutes, at Buena Vistas studios."
